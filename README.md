Dine and Dash: A fun app that helps users find a nearby restaurant and closest means of escaping the bill!

Built using HTML, CSS, React and REST API's (Yelp, CityBikes and MapBox)

The app allows users to search for a restaurant by location, filter results by cuisine/price/ratings and see restaurant details. Alongside the restaurant details, users will find a map, route overlay and step-by-step directions from that restaurant to the nearest bike share location.
